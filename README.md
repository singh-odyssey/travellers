# travellersmeet

Meet verified travellers. Make real connections.

travellersmeet helps solo travellers find and connect with others heading to the same destination around the same dates. Travellers upload a proof-of-travel ticket, get verified, and then become discoverable to other verified travellers for that trip window. Privacy-first: only verified users can view other verified profiles for matching destinations.

## Whatâ€™s inside
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Authentication with credentials (NextAuth v5) and Prisma
- Ticket upload with a simple verification workflow
- Matching by destination and date window (visibility only for verified users)
- Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI
- PostgreSQL via Prisma

## How it works (high level)
1) Sign up or sign in with email and password
2) Upload your ticket for the upcoming trip
3) After verification, discover other verified travellers for the same destination/date window
